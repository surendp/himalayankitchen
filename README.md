## Work Flow

As a whole, the project is a maven project and it uses the concept of Restful webservices to develop the backend. Lunch and Ala kart menu lists are delivered through the Rest APIs created by using Spring-Boot.

Also, reservation form data is delivered to an API which further sends the message to restaurant email using Java.

The User Interface of the website is managed/developed using React.js.

This functionality is implemented in the following way:
- Create Rest API using Spring-Boot.
